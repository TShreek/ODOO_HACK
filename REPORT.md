# Backend Improvement Report

## 1. Overview
This report summarizes the enhancements made to the ODOO_HACK backend: reliability, observability, security, test coverage, and operational readiness. The system now exposes master data CRUD, authentication (JWT), readiness & health endpoints, metrics, rate limiting, load test scaffolding, and CI enforcement.

## 2. Architecture Summary
- Framework: FastAPI (async)
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.x async (Postgres primary, SQLite fallback)
- Auth: JWT (HS256) + bcrypt password hashing
- Data Domains: Contacts, Products, Taxes, Chart of Accounts (seeded baseline)
- Observability: Structured JSON logging, Request ID middleware, metrics endpoint, health & readiness
- Security: Rate limiting (per-process token bucket), SECURITY.md guidance
- Testing: pytest (async), coverage gate >=80%
- CI: GitHub Actions (lint import check, tests, coverage artifact)
- Load Testing: k6 scenario script (auth + contacts CRUD)

## 3. Key Features Added
| Category | Additions |
|----------|-----------|
| Operational | `/api/v1/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` |
| Observability | JSON logging config, Request ID middleware, metrics middleware |
| Reliability | Postgres→SQLite fallback with visibility flags |
| Security | Rate limiting middleware, SECURITY.md, secret scan guidance |
| Testing | Auth + masters E2E, masters edge cases, coverage config |
| Performance | Basic load test script (k6) |
| Tooling | CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforcing tests + coverage |

## 4. Fallback & Readiness Model
- Health (`/api/v1/healthz`): DB liveness + fallback flags.
- Readiness (`/readyz`): DB ping + seed (chart of accounts) presence.
- Fallback: Automatic SQLite engine initialization if primary Postgres fails on startup. Not reversible at runtime (requires restart to reconnect to Postgres after recovery).

## 5. Metrics
Endpoint: `/metrics`
Fields: `requests_total`, `requests_errors` (5xx), `avg_latency_ms`
Scope: In-memory (resets on process restart). Extension path: export to Prometheus.

## 6. Rate Limiting
- Middleware: In-memory token bucket (per-IP) with default 30 req / 60s (burst 60).
- Response: HTTP 429 JSON with `retry_after_seconds`.
- Scaling Note: Needs Redis / global store for multi-instance environments.

## 7. Security Posture
Implemented:
- Bcrypt hashing, short-lived JWT.
- Separation liveness vs readiness.
- Rate limiting (prototype).
- Secrets externalized via env (placeholder values).
- Minimal PII logging; request IDs for traceability.
Planned (documented in SECURITY.md):
- Centralized secret manager, stronger auth hardening, SAST/DAST, distributed limiter, security headers.

## 8. Test Coverage & Suites
Tests Added/Enhanced:
- `test_auth_masters_e2e.py`: Register → login → list accounts.
- `test_masters_edge_cases.py`: Pagination, search, 404s across entities.
- Coverage gate (80%) via pyproject `addopts`.
Suggested Future Tests:
- Negative auth token tampering.
- High-volume metrics accuracy under load.
- Rate limit exceed scenarios.

## 9. CI Pipeline
Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
Steps: Checkout → Python setup → Install deps → Import lint check → Run tests (quiet) → Coverage XML (fail under 80%) → Upload artifact.
Enhancement Opportunities:
- Add caching for pip.
- Add dependency vulnerability scan (`pip-audit`).
- Add matrix (Python 3.11+3.12) after stability.

## 10. Load Testing
Script: `load/k6_scenario.js`
Covers: User registration/login, contact creation, contacts list, metrics fetch.
Thresholds: p95 < 800ms, checks success >95%.
Extensions:
- Separate scenario for product search.
- Ramp to higher concurrency (50–100 VUs) for baseline capacity.

## 11. Operational Runbook Highlights
Rollback & Recovery: `backend/ROLLBACK.md`
Checklist extended with readiness, metrics stability, rate limit noise, request ID tracing.
Added Observability Notes: In-memory nature of metrics, per-process rate limiting.

## 12. Configuration
`.env.example` includes placeholders:
- `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `HSN_API_KEY`.
Recommendation: Add log level, request ID header override (already partially integrated if extended later).

## 13. File Inventory (Key Additions)
- `infrastructure/observability/request_id_middleware.py`
- `infrastructure/observability/logging_config.py`
- `infrastructure/observability/metrics_middleware.py`
- `infrastructure/observability/rate_limit_middleware.py`
- `api/healthz.py`, `api/readyz.py`
- `load/k6_scenario.js`
- `SECURITY.md`, updated `ROLLBACK.md`, enriched `README.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## 14. Known Limitations
- No persistent metrics or tracing backend.
- Rate limiting not distributed.
- JWT revocation not implemented.
- Fallback cannot auto-promote back to Postgres.
- Missing advanced domain validations (e.g., tax rate bounds enforcement beyond schema layer).

## 15. Recommended Next Steps
Short Term:
1. Add Prometheus exporter & histogram latencies.
2. Redis-backed rate limiter.
3. API key or role-based separation for admin endpoints.
4. Add mutation audit log table.
Mid Term:
5. Add SAST (Semgrep) to CI + `pip-audit` job.
6. Implement token revocation list or rotate secret strategy.
7. Introduce structured error responses with trace codes.
Long Term:
8. Move to Alembic migrations.
9. Add multi-tenant isolation tests & enforcement constraints.
10. Implement inventory & ledger financial reconciliation endpoints.

## 16. How to Run (Quick Reference)
```bash
# Install (from backend/)
uv pip install -e .[test]

# Start API (dev)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Run coverage (enforced)
pytest

# Load test (from repo root)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 k6 run load/k6_scenario.js

# Security scan suggestion
pip install pip-audit && pip-audit
```

## 17. Conclusion
The backend moved from a basic CRUD/auth prototype to an operationally aware service with observability, security scaffolding, testing discipline, and CI enforcement. Remaining gaps are mostly around scaling resilience, distributed rate limiting, token revocation, and production-grade metrics. This foundation supports iterative hardening without large refactors.
