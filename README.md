## ü§ù Architecture
Our system uses a hybrid microservices architecture with an event-driven core. The frontend communicates with a fast, non-blocking FastAPI service. For every financial transaction, the API service publishes an event to a Kafka topic. A separate Kafka consumer service then processes these events asynchronously, ensuring that data is written to the PostgreSQL database reliably and without impacting API responsiveness. This approach guarantees data integrity, scalability, and high performance.
